# Handwritten Digit Prediction using MNIST Dataset

This project uses a model trained on the MNIST dataset to predict handwritten digits. The model is built using a simple Sequential neural network and is capable of recognizing digits from 0 to 9. It processes input images of 28x28 pixel grayscale digits.

The project also uses Gradio to create an interactive interface. Users can draw a digit on the sketchpad, and the system will process the drawing, resize it, and make a prediction based on the trained model. The predicted digit is then displayed.
